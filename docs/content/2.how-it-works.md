# How It Works

This page explains how our packages work with Nimiq Keyguard. We cover the main ideas so that anyone, technical or not, can understand the flow. This page also shows what the `core` package does and does not do, along with some sample code and links to more detailed pages.

## Overview

In simple terms, when a user clicks the **Login** button, the server creates a JWT (JSON Web Token) containing a challenge. The user then uses their keyguard to sign this JWT. The signed JWT is sent back to the server where it is verified. This ensures that the user owns the key and that the login is secure.

## What the Core Package Does

The `core` package provides the basic tools for cryptographic operations and JWT handling. It **doesn't** manage user sessions or hold any database logic. Here is a clear view of its responsibilities:

| **Responsibility**             | **Handled by Core Package** | **Not Handled**                       |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| JWT creation and verification  | Yes                         | User session management               |
| Cryptographic signing and hash | Yes                         | Database storage of user data         |
| Integration with Nimiq Hub API | Yes                         | UI and other client-side interactions |
| Endpoints                      | No                          | Should be handled by the integrations |
| Database, Session & Cookies    | No                          | Should be handled by the integrations |

## The Authentication Flow

### JWT Signing and Verification

1. **Client side:**.
   - The client clicks the **Login** button.
   - The client sends a request to the server to generate a JWT.

2. **Server side:**.
   - The server generates a JWT containing a short-lived challenge.
   - The JWT is signed with a secret key using HMAC SHA256.
   - The JWT is sent to the client.

3. **Client side:**.
   - The client receives the JWT.
   - The client uses the Nimiq Keyguard (via the Hub API) to sign the JWT.
   - The signed JWT is sent back to the server along with the public key.

4. **Server Side (Verification):**.
   - The server verifies that the JWT is valid and has not expired.
   - The server verifies the signature against the challenge hash.
   - If the signature is confirmed, the server can trust that the user has the appropriate key.

### Client-Side Pseudocode

Below is a simplified diagram to illustrate the process:

Each step includes error handling. If any step fails, the login process is stopped, and an error is returned to the client.

## Why Use JWT in This Process?

Using JWTs in our flow has several advantages:

- Security: The JWT contains a short-lived challenge that limits the time an attacker can use it.
- Statelessness:** The server does not need to hold a session for the user. All required data is contained in the token.
- Ease of use:** JWTs are easy to generate and verify using standard libraries.
- Easy revocation:** Since JWTs have an expiration date, old tokens are automatically invalidated.

This method also keeps the process light. It avoids the need for a full access/refresh token system, which can add complexity.

## Storing the User in the Database

When a user is successfully authenticated

1. The server extracts the public key from the signed JWT.
2. This public key can be used as a unique identifier for the user.
3. You can store the public key along with any additional user information you need (such as a username or email).

A basic example of a user record might look like this

| **Field**    | **Description**                                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `userId`     | A unique ID for the user (can be the public key or address) |
| `publicKey`  | The public key in hexadecimal format                        |
| `createdAt`  | Timestamp when the user first logged in                     |
| `lastLogin`  | Timestamp of the last login                                 |

This allows the user to be tracked in your database without the need for additional session management.
